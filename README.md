# Statistic-Calculator

All of this program is a program to help calculate statistical values that help to solve complex data collection and computational problems where I have applied my knowledge of the python programming language to the statistical data calculations available in the Ministry of Education's curriculum. Consists of finding

1. Mean, Mode, and Median
2. Quartile, Deciles, and Percentile
3. Variance and Standard deviation

Users can use by filling data that you want for statistical analysis. After that, the program will show the values from the analysis of the data in detail.
